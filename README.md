# E-Commerce Website: A Full-Stack Development Project Using PHP, CSS, HTML, JS & SQL

This project showcases a comprehensive e-commerce website, built from the ground up using PHP, CSS, HTML, JS, and SQL. The codebase has been meticulously structured using Visual Studio Code 1.85.1 (Universal).

## Project Overview

This e-commerce website is a testament to efficient and effective implementation of both frontend and backend code using PHP. It serves as a practical demonstration of how PHP can be leveraged to construct the fundamental architecture of a dynamic and interactive website.

## Getting Started

To get this project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Install the Prerequisites**: Ensure you have XAMPP installed, which includes PHP, Apache Web Server, and MySQL Database.

2. **Customize the Code**: Feel free to modify the code according to your requirements using an editor of your choice.

3. **Test Locally**: Before deploying the website, make sure to test it on your local area network/private network to ensure everything is functioning as expected.

4. **Request a Static IP**: Once you're satisfied with the website's performance, request a static IP from your ISP and configure your web server accordingly to make the website live.

5. **Manage Product Images**: To add or update product images, identify the postID, retrieve the ID, and rename the image file in the format 'productID.jpeg'. Ensure the image adheres to a square cropping format and has a high resolution to prevent distortion or blurriness. Upload the image to the 'Products' directory once it meets these criteria.

## Important Notices

1. **Data Security**: Exercise caution when handling sensitive customer/administration data. Avoid sharing admin or database login credentials with untrusted parties.

2. **Pre-Launch Checks**: Double-check all aspects of the website before making it live.

3. **Product Representation**: All products displayed on the website are for representation purposes only.

## Demonstration

A 'DEMO' directory containing illustrative images is included in the repository.
